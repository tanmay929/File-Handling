        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line an interpreter.Python is an interpreted language,meaning the python code is executed directly without needing to be compiled into machine code beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        " Compiled languages are first translated into machine code (binary code) by a compiler before execution.Languages like C and C++ are compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python refers to managing errors or exceptional conditons that arise during program excution.Python uses try,except,else,and finally blocks to handle evxeptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally bolck is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, such as releasing resources, closing files, or closing database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging is a way to record information,warnings, and errors that occur in a progam.The logging module allows you to track events during the execution of a program,which helps in debugging and monitoring.It provides various log levels(e.g.,DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The del method is a special method used for object destruction. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed,typically when it goes out of scope or is deleted.Its commonly used for cleanup operations,like closing file or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import module_name : This import the entire module,and you need to reference the module by its name to access its functions or classes(e.g.,math.sqrt(16))\n",
        "\n",
        " from module_name import function_name : This imports only the specific function or class from a module,so you can use it directly without the module prefix(e.g.,sqrt(16)).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple exceptions can be handled in Python by using multiple except blocks,or by specifing multiple exception types in a single except block (e.g.,except(TypeError,ValueError).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file after it is used,even if an exception occurs. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreding : Involves multiple threads within a single process. Thread share the same memory space and can run concurrently,but they are subject to Pythons Global Intrepreter Lock(GIL),limiting parallel execution in a CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        " Multiprocessing : Involves multiple processes with separate memory spaces. It allows for true parallelism,making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Debugging : Hepls trace the flow of execution and identify issues.Error\n",
        "\n",
        " Reporting : Logs can report errors and provide detailed stack traces.\n",
        "\n",
        " Monitoring : Logs can track performance and behavior over time,helpful in production system\n",
        "\n",
        " Persistence : Logs can be stored in files,databases,or remote services for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Python uses automatic memory management with a built-in garbage collection system that keeps track of and frees memory that is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Try block:Wrap the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        " Except block:Specify how to handle specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        " Else block:Execute code if no exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        " Finally block:Execute cleanup code,regardless of exception status.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Proper memory management ensures that programs are efficient and do not waste resources. Unused memory or memory leaks can slow down the system and lead to crashes. Python handle memory management automatically but still requires developers awareness to avoid excessive memory use.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - The try block contains code that may raise an exeption. The except block catches and handles the exception if it occurs,preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory. When an objects refrences count drop to zero (no longer in use),the memory is deallocated. The garbage collector handles circular references that reference counting alone cannot clean up.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block runs if no exception is raised in the try block. It execute code that should run when the try block completes successfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - The logging module provides several levels of logging,from most detailed to least:\n",
        "\n",
        " DEBUG:Dtailed information,typically useful only for diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        " INFO:General information about program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " WARNING:Indicates something unexpected ,but the program can continue.\n",
        "\n",
        " ERROR:Indicates a problem that prevents a function from working correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        " CRITICAL:A very serious error that may cause the program to crash.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork():Creates a child process by duplicating the calling process.It's a low-level function and generally used in Unix-based system. It doesnot easily support Python's memory management and garbage collection mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Multiprocessing:The multiprocessing module is a higher-level abstraction that allows spawing multiple processes with separate memory spaces. It is more flexible,portable,and supports better communication and synchronization between processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Releasing Resorces:When a file is opened,system resources(such as file handles)are used. Closing the file ensures that these resources are properly released,preventing potential memory leaks or issues when opening new files.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data Integrity:If a file is not closed,any buffered data may not be written to the disk,which can lead to data loss. Closing the file ensures that all changes are committed.\n",
        "\n",
        " File Locking:In some system,files may be locked when opened and closing them releases this lock,allowing other processes to access the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " - file.read():Reads the entire content of the file as a single string,including newlines. This is useful when you need to load the entire file content into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " file.readline():Reads one line at a time from the file. It includes the newline character at the end of each line. It's useful for reading large files line by line, without loading the entire file into memory at once. python copy code.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - The logging module in Python is used for tracking and recording events,errors,and other information during the execution of a program. It provides a way to log messages with different severity levels,such as:\n",
        "\n",
        " DEBUG:Dtailed information for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        " INFO:General information about program's operation.\n",
        "\n",
        " WARNING:Warning about potential problems.\n",
        "\n",
        " ERROR:Errors that occurs during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " CRITICAL:Severe errors that may prevent the program from continuing.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system and perform various file-handling operations. It allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        " Navigate directories:Use functions like os.chdir(),os.listdir() to change directories,get the current directory,and list directory contents.\n",
        "\n",
        " File operations:Create,remove,and rename files using functions like os.remove(),os.rename(),and os.makedirs().\n",
        "\n",
        " File properties:Use os.stat() to get information about a file,such as size and modification time.\n",
        "\n",
        " Permissions:Change file permissions using os.chmod().\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Garbage Collection:While Python has automated garbage collection,issues like circular references (objects referring to each other) can cause memory to not be freed as expected,leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        " Memory Overhead: Python's memory management system adds some overhead due to features like dynamic typing and automatic reference counting,which can lead to higher memory usage compared to lower-level language.\n",
        "\n",
        " Large Data Structures:Handling large data sets(such as large list and dictionaries)can cause significant memory consuption,especially if they are not optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        " Limited Control:Python's memory management is abstracted away,so developers have limited control over the memory allocation and deallocation process,which may hinder optimization in certain cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - In Python,exceptions can be raised manually using the raise statement. This is typically done when you want to signal an error condition in your program\n",
